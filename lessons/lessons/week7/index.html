	<ol class="steps">
        <!-- Topic 1 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Even more with R (writing simple software)</h1>
          <p>Review everything you did last week, and do some more! This is where things start getting very freeform and directed by your data- start really working towards the scientific questions your students asked of the data.</p>
          <p>Depending on where you are with your data and analysis, we may want to introduce plotting with ggplot2- we can work on this in the seminar.</p>
        </li>
        <!-- Topic 1 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Authorship in the digital age</h1>
          <p>We talked about the 'traditional' definition of authorship on scienctific products a couple weeks ago, but now that we're a little deeper, you can see there's (even) more layers than what we discussed. Please complete the readings below and we'll have a class discussion on Wednesday.</p>

        </li>
        </ol>

  <!-- EXERCISES -->
  	<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Loops, Conditionals and functions</strong></li>
        <p>And student directed analyses! Look! See what you find! This is the fun part :)  </p>

        <h3>Authorship on data, authorship in collaboration</h3>
              <p> Now that you're a little deeper into the course, you're ready for a more in-depth discussion about scientific authorship. The readings here are meant to present some extreme views and really provoke discussion. Please read these readings prior to class on Thursday.</p>

          <h3>Readings</h3>
        <p>
          <p><a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-authorship-on-software-papers.html">Pubwication of software papers, and authorship on them.</a> This is a blog post by Titus Brown, a professor of data-intensive biology at UC Davis. Titus’ group built a software product, khmer, out in the open, and invited contributions from the community. Long story short, he awarded authorship to everyone who contributed when he published a paper on the subject, no matter what the contribution was. This sparked a big debate in the community about what authorship really meant. </p>
          <p><a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1516564">Data Sharing</a> (an editorial from the New England Journal of Medicine).This editorial presents another view of authorship- namely, making 	the argument that data is essentially owned by those who collected it, and that no derivative works should be created without the data owner’s permission. </p>
          <p><a href="https://practicaldatamanagement.wordpress.com/2016/01/22/a-fundamental-difference-of-opinion/">A Fundamental Difference of Opinion</a> is blog post by me in response to the above editorial.</p>
          </p>

          <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p>

            <p><em>Why is there a discrepancy between the way credit is offered to data and software?  </em></p>
            <p><em>Are data and software research products?</em></p>
            <p><em>What is the best way to credit data and software creators? </em></p>
