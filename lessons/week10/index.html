          <h1>Free learning period </h1>
          <p>I will be away this Thursday, doing exciting things in exciting places, but I've shifted content around a bit to help keep you busy. Your primary mission is to push your projects forward as much as possible, but I would also like you to spend some time with materials introducing you to participatory models of science. We're going to start with a biomedical example, because I find this particularly compelling. Please read <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/billofhealth/2017/03/06/participant-power/">this post</a> by <a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/jason-bobe">Jason Bobe</a>, a biomedical researcher and Associate Professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. Jason and I met through the Mozilla Fellows program, and he's devoted his career to bringing together biomedical researchers, patients and doctors to get a more holistic understanding (but not in the woo-woo way) of human health- that can only be realized by approaching medical research using open frameworks. In lieu of a lecture in class this week, please watch Jason's talk from last year. </p>

          <h1>Project Management on Github</h1>
          <p> With regards to specific project progress, I would like you to meet with your group members sometime during the week and populate your github repos with a specific task list, detailing the steps you need to take to complete your projects. In class on Tuesday, we will start this process with an activity, detailed below.</p>
        </li>

  <!-- EXERCISES -->
  	<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Github issues</strong></li>
        <p>Use github issues to create a list of things to do for your paper, and assign tasks to group members. If you need a github referesher, <a href="http://joeyklee.github.io/friendly-github-intro/">this workshop</a> can help guide you in setting up your whole project in github. Basically, what I want to see is a task list that can hold us all accountable to get our projects rounded out and ready to go!</p>

      <h3>Participatory models for bigger science</h3>
      <p>With increased connectivity, we have the opportunity to bring our work to audiences that have never been engaged in science before. This is a good opportunity for students to explore the differences in participatory models between fields, and discuss what engagement means in different fields. We provide a more extreme example, with participatory biomedical research- how do we  engage people in our work when the direct ties to their well-being are more tenuous? Next week we'll look at participatory models in ecology.</p>

    </p>

      <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p>

        <p><em>How can we use participatory models for research in our field?</em></p>
        <p><em>How would citizen science engagement differ between fields?</em></p>
        <p><em>What can we do to motivate people to participate in science?</em></p>
