          <h1>Open source beehives</h1>
          <p>We're in the home stretch, and I want to spend the majority of the time we have left together co-working on our projects to get as much done as we can before the semester's done. However, we've still got a bit to unpack about our recent guest speakers, and a few other aspects of open, technologically enabled science. <br>
          To keep your minds buzzing, though (see what I did there?) check out <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/03/open-source-beehives/">this article</a>, and accompanying video, about open source beehives.

                    <strong> Choose your own adventure</strong> You will probably generate more figures than youâ€™ll want for the final paper. A good way to decide which ones to use is print them all out, then arrange them in an order that makes sense- so your manuscript tells a story about how you approached the data, and discard the redundant ones, or relegate them to a supplemental information file. Having the tactile-ness of printed figures encourages you to experiment with a few different ways to order the story.

        <li><strong>Revisit the list of github issues in project repo for tasks needing completion</strong></li>
        <p>Make this a comprehensive list- everything from writing the abstract to inserting the references. Assign specific collegues to tasks. Assess progress towards your goals.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Check up on the collaborative process</h3>
        <p>An informal discussion that doubles as a chance to flesh out where the project is going. <em> How is the collaborative process working? Do we need to make adjustments to get the project done?</em> Use our answers to these questions to help populate/adjust the github issue list.</p>
